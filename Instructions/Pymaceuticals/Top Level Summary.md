During my analysis of the mouse and study result datasets, I found that while 249 mice were tested, 1 mouse (g989), appeared to have
duplicated data associated with it. As it was unclear which data could be trusted for this mouse, it was removed from my analysis. 
The number of female vs male mice tested is almost equal as females represented 49.6% of the data set, leaving males representing 50.4%.

When looking at the tumor volume of Capomulin tested mice as compared to mice tested with other drugs, the average tumor volume throughout testing is
lower. Capomulin tumor volume averages out at the lowest volume of drug regimens at 40.67. The next closest tumor volume occurs with Caftamin at 52.59 and the 
remaining drug regimens go up from there. 

In my analysis, I also looked at the final tumor volume for each mouse tested. Capomulin and Ramicane appear to have similar effects as the final tumor volumes for 
mice tested with these drugs is in a 31-41 mm3 range. Mice treated with other drugs, such as Infubinal and Ceftamin, had much higher 
final tumor volumes (in a 48-66 mm3 range).

My analysis shows a line plot of tumor volume vs time point for mouse s185. Visually, you can see that her tumor volume did significantly decrease over the 
course of the study. One mouse doesn't necessarily represent the entire dataset, so I also performed this same analysis on the following mice treated with Capomulin:
x401
m601
f966
u364
y793
r554

These mice all showed similar results, with tumor volumes significantly decreasing over time. 

The final piece of my analysis looked at the tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin and how it may relate to the weight of the mouse.
Average tumor volume does positively correlate to the mouse's weight. Meaning, the higher the weight of the mouse, the more likely that mouse 
will have a larger tumor volume. This analysis, however, only looked at the average tumor volumes and weights over the course of the study. 

While this analysis provides good information, I would recommend a deeper look at the final tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin. A mouse with a
higher weight could have a larger tumor, but that tumor could also decrease in size significantly over the course of the study. As a next step, I would
want to dive deeper into our final tumor volumes so that we can better understand the end result for our Capomulin treated mice.
