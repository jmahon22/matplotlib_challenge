During my analysis of the mouse and study result datasets, I found that while 249 mice were tested, 1 mouse (g989), appeared to have
duplicated data associated with it. As it was unclear which data could be trusted for this mouse, it was removed from my analysis. 
The number of female vs male mice tested is almost equal as females represented 49.6% of the data set, leaving males representing 50.4%.

When looking at the tumor volume of Capomulin tested mice as compared to mice tested with other drugs, the average tumor volume is
lower. Capomulin tumor volume averages out at the lowest volume of drug regimens at 40.67. The next closest tumor volume occurs with Caftamin at 52.59 and the 
remaining drug regimens go up from there. 
However, in my analysis, I also looked at the final tumor volume for each mouse tested. Capomulin appears to have a similar effectiveness as Ramicane, 
with the end median of Capomulin tumors being 38.12 in comparison to Ramicane's of 36.56.
Interestingly, the tumor volume for mice treated with Capomulin positively correlates to the mouse's weight. Meaning, the higher the weight of the mouse, the 
more likely that mouse will have a larger tumor volume at the end of treatment.
